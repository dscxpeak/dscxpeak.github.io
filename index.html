            <div class="col">
                <p>Since its inception in 2020, the Data Science Club at NYU has been committed to providing
                    opportunities for the student body. Our Datathon is one of our capstone events, bringing together
                    hundreds of students to work with unique datasets and apply their skills to real world problems.
                    This year, we have the honor of working with Peak! We look forward to the challenges they will bring
                    to the table!</p>

                <h3>Exploring Customer Preferences: The Sandbox Challenge</h3>
                <p>Goal: To enhance the shopping experience of customers, retailers need to know as much about customer
                    preferences and behaviour as possible</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Data such as transactional, user, and product data can be used to generate insights about
                        customers
                    </li>
                    <li>These insights can enhance the experience of customers and make them more likely to purchase,
                        increasing sales for the retailer
                    </li>
                    <li>They can also allow retailers to explore demand for their different products and see if their
                        current stock is performing well.
                    </li>
                    <li>This may lead to a shift in direction for the business, through focusing on different products
                        or trends in the future
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>During this challenge, you will generate insights for an online retailer based on the data available
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You will present these insights back at the end of the datathon, imagining that you are a data
                        scientist presenting to a retailer that has hired you to do this work
                    </li>
                    <li>This challenge will require great technical and communication skills, with each group analysing
                        the data and also explaining why your insights are beneficial to the retailer
                    </li>

            </div>
            <div class="col ">
                <h3>Recommendation System: The Machine Learning Challenge</h3>
                <p>Goal: To enhance the shopping experience of customers, product recommenders are often used
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        They take transactional, user, and product data to provide personalised recommendations

                    </li>

                    <li>These allow customers to be targeted with the products that they are most likely to purchase,
                        increasing sales for the retailer

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>During this challenge, you will construct a product recommender
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You will generate products that you think should be recommended to a list of customers based on
                        the data available

                    </li>
                    <li>You will then report your findings back, imagining that you are a data scientist presenting to a
                        retailer that has hired you to do this work

                    </li>
                    <li> This challenge will require great technical and communication skills, with each group
                        constructing a recommender and also explaining what you have done to a non-technical audience
                    </li>
